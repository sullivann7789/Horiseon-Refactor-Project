# Horiseon Refactor Project
### By Noah Sullivan

- The following project is a model page for an online media marketing agency.

- The purpose of my work on this page was to refactor, and clean the working code structure. 

- The code, in both HTML, and CSS, is better functioning, and more organized for developers and users alike. 

- A bug was identified particularly in the <href> function of the search engine optimization head title. Now it is functioning properly.
